# ASPT-assignments
This repository contains my solutions for the programming assignments of the "Advanced Signal Processing Techniques" course.
The assignments consist of 4 different exercises which aim to familiarise the students with concepts such as:
1) the role of higher order statistics (3rd and 4th order cumulants and spectra) in detecting
   non-linear phenomena like quadratic phase coupling. 
2) the use of cepstrum and quefrency-domain tools in human speech analysis.

The programming tasks were solved using MATLAB. In order to execute the provided scripts, you will also need to install the
"High Order Statistics Analysis Toolbox" (HOSA Toolbox). This repository is organised in 4 folders. Every folder contains 
MATLAB scripts, input files as well as report which presents my findings for every assignment. The reports are written in 
Greek, but they will probably be translated in English at some point in the near future. Other than that, this repository 
will not be maintained and it won't receive any other updates.
