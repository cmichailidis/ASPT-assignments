# ASPT-assignments
This repository contains my solutions for the programming assignments of the "Advanced Signal Processing Techniques" course.
The assignments consist of 4 different exercises which aim to familiarise the students with concepts such as:
1) the role of higher order statistics (3rd and 4th order cumulants and spectra) in detecting
   non-linear phenomena like quadratic phase coupling. 
2) the use of cepstrum and quefrency-domain tools in human speech analysis.

The programming tasks were solved using Octave. In order to calculate certain quantities such as the Bispectrum and Higher
Order Cumulants, I used my own custom version of the "Higher-Order Spectral Analysis Toolbox" (HOSA Toolbox). However, you 
don't have to install this Toolbox in order to run the scripts, because all the necessary utility files are included in this
repository.

The repository is organised in 4 folders. Every folder contains Octave scripts, input files as well as a report
which presents my findings for every assignment. The reports are written in Greek, but they will probably be translated in 
English at some point in the near future. That being said, this repository will not be maintained and it won't receive 
any other updates.
